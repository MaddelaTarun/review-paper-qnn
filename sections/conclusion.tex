\section{Conclusion}

This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of Quantum Neural Networks for fake news detection, with a particular emphasis on adversarial robustness. A hybrid classical--quantum architecture is developed, trained on the WELFake dataset, and assessed under semantic-preserving attacks. Results demonstrate that QNNs provide competitive baseline accuracy and improved resilience against adversarial perturbations compared to classical models.

The findings establish QNNs as a promising avenue for developing secure and trustworthy misinformation detection systems. As quantum technology advances, deeper circuits and hardware-level optimizations may further strengthen the capabilities of quantum-enhanced classifiers.
